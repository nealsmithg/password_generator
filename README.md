# password_generator
This project was to crate a password generator to create a random password for the user. The user can create a password longer then 8 characters but no longer then 128. The user also picks what character types to use in creating the password.

This generator is avalible online for anyone to use. All you have to do is open the webpage and go through the page prompts in order to give the paramiters you would like the password to have. Then the page displays the password with the given paramiters.

When loaded the page should look like this and all you need to do is click on the red "Generate Password" button.
